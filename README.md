<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

Movemaster is a computer application designed to assist users in learning and performing basic strength and isometric exercises through interactive gameplay. It leverages computer vision to track the user’s movements from a standard camera (e.g., a laptop webcam or phone camera) and assesses the precision of each exercise in real time.

The core gameplay mechanics are inspired by classic arcade systems (e.g., Beat Saber, Dance Central) and reward players with points based on accurate movements. However, unlike those games, Movemaster does not require specialized hardware such as VR goggles or Kinect sensors, making it accessible to a broader audience.

Key project highlights:
* **User-friendly**: Operates with minimal hardware requirements (standard camera).
* **Engaging**: Incorporates arcade elements to sustain user motivation.
* **Modular**: Combines Unity 3D with a Python-based movement analysis module.
* **Scalable**: Uses websockets to communicate between Unity and the Python backend, allowing for flexible system architecture.

This project follows an agile (Scrum) methodology. Tools such as Git for version control and Taiga for task management ensure efficient collaboration and code quality. Development progresses iteratively, from initial market research and technology feasibility to final implementation of a fully functional application.
